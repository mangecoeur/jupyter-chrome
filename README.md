# Jupyter Viewer: A chrome app for interacting with Jupyter notebooks

A simple chrome packaged app for interacting with the Jupyter server. Get rid of the distracting browser user interface to put notebooks front-and-centre.

## What this is not

Unlike other attempts at something similar (including my own) this does not aim to manage the notebook server for you in any way - you still have to start it on the command line or set up a server somewhere. The idea is to have a very simple codebase which doesn't have to work to keep up with changes in the notebook itself.
